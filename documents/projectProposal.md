## Description

The Los Angeles Police Department Homicide Library Unit seeks a database solution for the management of case records dating back to 1960. Case records are currently stored in physical binders. Detectives need a more efficient system to store metadata about the case records, query data, and generate reports. CaseExplorer is an interactive web application and scalable database solution optimized for the management of physical case data.

The CaseExplorer web application has 3 main functions:
1. Upload Data

Upload information about a case record rapidly using CaseExplorer's Smart Document Analyzer. This system will analyze a LAPD Tag Sheet and perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to automatically import data to an interactive form.

2. Explore Data

Gain insights and efficiently query data from data through interactive data visualizations, powered by the popular visualization library, d3.js. 

3. Generate Reports

Summarize findings and export data into formatted reports. 

CaseExplorer is an alternative to Microsoft Excel, which neither allows for concurrent data access and editing nor scales to the Unit’s needs.

The software’s end users are organized into two tiers: general user and administrative. General users are clerks with lower security credentials who may only make queries and input data. Administrative access is given to the four members of the Homicide Library Unit. Special attention will be given to the usability of the software, as all end users have limited experience with new technology.

## Justification

We believe this project allows each team member to exercise the lessons and tools we have gained throughout our education at Loyola Marymount University as well as through individual experiences outside of our academics.

We will be implementing our frontend education, gained through Interaction Design, to create a user-friendly interface for individuals who have little experience with online database web-applications. We will also be able to use what we learn in our concurrent Intro to Database Systems course to implement the backend of our system.

Our project leaves room for us to grow and learn; none of the team members have ever implemented a database system or created a complex, full stack, web application to interact with a directly related backend system. We will spend time learning about what we want to implement in order to prepare a deliverable product to the Department by the end of the semester.

Each team member brings his or her own abilities to contribute, but will also be expanding his or her toolkit throughout the semester. We will proceed to gain new knowledge about our program, as we implement it, as well as other products and systems we will be incorporating in our project.

We are all excited by the opportunity to learn about database systems and web application interaction and implementation, while also being able to provide a public service for our city.
